PowerShell Script Repository

This is a repository of PowerShell scripts that I use a lot in my home lab or at the customer site. I'm an IT Pro focussing on Windows, Windows Server, Azure, System Center and Office 365. All scripts are mostly generic with variable settings up near the top or all parameter based.

You can contact me via my website, https://www.jpvr.nl or via Twitter <a href="https://www.twitter.com/JPvR_NL">@JPvR_NL</a>.
