# PowerShell
<b>PowerShell Script Repository</b><br>
This is a repository of PowerShell scripts that I use a lot in my home lab or at the customer site. I'm an IT Pro focussing on Windows, Windows Server, Azure, System Center and Office 365. All scripts are mostly generic with variable settings up near the top or all parameter based.

You can contact me via my website, https://www.jpvr.nl or via Twitter <a href="https://www.twitter.com/JPvR_NL">@JPvR_NL</a>.

<b>Disclaimer</b><br>
All scripts and other PowerShell references on this GitHub repository are offered "as is" with no warranty. While these scripts are tested and working in my environment, it is recommended that you test these scripts in a test environment before using in your production environment.
